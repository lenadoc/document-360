@(Info)()(This is how the Marketing Content Manager works in the Back Office to make the file setup that is going to be used when setting up a content item for a marketing or promotional campaign.)

In the File Manager section, a Marketing Content Manager can do the following:

* upload the files
* build the file tree structure by creating file directories and changing their order
* review the files available in the system
* define the MIME types
