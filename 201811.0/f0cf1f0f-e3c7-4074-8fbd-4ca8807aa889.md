@(Info)()(This is how the Sales people interact with E-Commerce Managers to set up the company account.)

The company accounts can be set up either in the Store Front by the company representatives or in the Back Office. The data is synchronized and the same structure is displayed in both places.

| Online Store | Back Office |
| --- | --- |

The Company Account section consists of the sections that are logically connected to each other. So the setup flow looks the following:
* **Companies** - create a company record
* **Company Units** - set up company units by assigning them to the company
* **Company Unit Addresses** - set up the company unit addresses and assign them to the company units
* **Company Roles** - create company user roles to use them when creating users
* **Company Users** - create company users and assign them to appropriate business units
