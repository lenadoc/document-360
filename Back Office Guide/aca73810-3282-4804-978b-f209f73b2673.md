The **Threshold** section in Back Office is mostly used by Category Managers.
When doing business online, there comes a time when you need to set a minimum order amount to ensure that the cost of shipping the order is worthwhile for the business. This minimum order amount is configured in the Threshold section in the Administration Interface.

@(Info)()(The minimum order value can be used for both B2B and B2C businesses. The difference is that the thresholds in the B2B environment can be set up for a specific merchant relation, while in the B2C world this option is not used.)

Thresholds can be hard and soft, based on merchant relationships, applied globally. In case the hard threshold is configured, a buyer cannot proceed to the checkout if the buyer's cart value is below the minimum order value specified in that threshold. With a soft threshold, a customer still can proceed to the checkout, but a warning message or an additional fee can be added to the order sum as a penalty.
