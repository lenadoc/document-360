The Order Matrix page displays the information about ordered items.

When you navigate to the **Overview of Order Matrix** page (**Sales > Order Matrix**), you see the following information:
* The statuses of the ordered items
* The number of items with a specific status

The numbers are hyperlinked. If selected, you will be redirected to the **Overview of Orders** page. The table will display only the order(s) that contains the items with the selected status.
_For example_, you have five items with the **exported** status. When you click _5_ on the **Overview of Order Matrix** page, you will see the **Overview of Orders** page filtered by orders with the exported items only.
