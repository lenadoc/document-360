### Shopping List

@(Info)()(Company users use shopping lists to prepare and manage orders that they do regularly. For example, a restaurant can prepare lists for their regular orders of meat, vegetables, and drinks. These lists can be merged into one cart, adjusted and checked out by the chef on a daily basis.)
