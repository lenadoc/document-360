The web shop users can print their shopping lists, as well as shopping lists shared with them, in two ways:

* from *My Accountâ†’Shopping Lists* page:
![Overview page](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/Features/Shopping+Lists/actions-overview-page.png){height="" width=""}

* from Shopping List View page (which can be accessed by clicking on the name of a shopping list on Shopping Lists page):
![Shopping list details page](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/Features/Shopping+Lists/shopping-list-details-page.png){height="" width=""}

Clicking *Print* opens a printable version of a *Shopping List* page, which contains the shopping lists name, product barcode, SKU, name, default price and note:
