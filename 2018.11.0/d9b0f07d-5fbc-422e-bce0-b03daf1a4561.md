Bringing flexible shipping options in your online business may have a key impact on the purchasing decisions of your customers. For example, they might want to buy presents for the holidays and ship them to different addresses. With just the standard single delivery, they would have to place multiple orders for this. To make it easier for your customers to manage their orders and shipments, you can suggest them an option to split a single order into multiple shipments. Technically, this can be achieved with the **Split Delivery** feature, which allows delivering order items to different shipping addresses and on different days, with different shipment methods.

Therefore, the **Split Delivery** feature is best suited when you want to:

* deliver order across multiple dates and addresses
* attract more customers
* grow your business
* make customers' shopping experience easier and more convenient
