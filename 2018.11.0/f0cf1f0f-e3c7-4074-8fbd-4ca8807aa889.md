The Company Account section consists of the sections that are logically connected to each other. So the setup flow looks the following:
* **Companies** - create a company record
* **Company Units** - set up company units by assigning them to the company
* **Company Unit Addresses** - set up the company unit addresses and assign them to the company units
* **Company Roles** - create company user roles to use them when creating users
* **Company Users** - create company users and assign them to appropriate business units
