## Navigation

### Navigation Overview

@(Info)()(Every shop can have several independent navigation trees. For instance, there can be the main navigation that contains links to category pages or content pages.)

@(Warning)()(The main difference to Categories is that a Category Tree represents a hierarchical structure for the Products while a Navigation is just a nested list of links.)

**Structure**:

* An entry in the Navigation has a name.
* The underlying tree structure is represented by Navigation Nodes.

  - *node_type* - can be "category", "link, "external_url", "cms_page" or "label".

* There is one URL per localized Navigation Node. The URL is the only link to the resource. There are no other relations in the schema.
