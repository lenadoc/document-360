## Zed Administration

### Zed Users and ACL

@(Info)()(There can be multiple admin users with roles and permissions.)

            ![](../Resources/Images/Databaase Schema Guide/zed-users-acl.png)

**Structure**:

* Users belong to Groups (e.g. "Operation Manager").
* Groups have Roles (e.g. "Manage Orders").
* Roles have Rules which define what the Role is allowed or disallowed to do.
* A Rule is a URL.
* type - allow/deny.
* `bundle/controller/action` - describes an URL (e.g. `oms/trigger/trigger-event-for-order-items`). Each segment can be replaced by a wildcard (e.g. `oms/*/*`).
* The term *"bundle"* is deprecated and was substituted by the term *"module"*. We kept the column name for BC reasons.
