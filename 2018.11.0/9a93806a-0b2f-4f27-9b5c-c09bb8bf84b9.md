Spryker allows you to change the modules included in a project at your will. You can add, remove, upgrade etc the modules a project consists of or even build a unique set of modules that suits specifically your needs. To do so:

1. Start with an existing Spryker, such as the B2C, B2B boilerplates or your own project based on Spryker Commerce OS.

2. Add or remove modules as necessary using Composer. All available modules can be found in the following repositories:

   <https://github.com/spryker-shop/>*

   <https://github.com/spryker/>*
