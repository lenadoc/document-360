Both credit card and PayPal utilize the same request flow. It basically consists of the following requests:

* <b>Pre-check</b>: to check the user information in order to make sure that all the needed information is correct before doing the actual pre-authorization.
* <b>Authorize</b>: to perform a payment risk check which is a mandatory step before every payment. The payment is basically considered accepted when it is authorized.
* <b>Revert:</b> to cancel the authorization step which basically cancels the payment before capturing.
* Capture: to capture the payment and receive money from the buyer.
* <b>Refund</b>: to refund the buyer when returning products.
