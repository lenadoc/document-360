During the checkout process your customers can easily select their preferred shipment method and related carrier. You can integrate several shipping carriers and methods and define their availability. Your customers can easily see which carrier offers which shipment method in their respective region and select their preference. The carriers and their shipment methods are neatly grouped in the Cart interface of your shop.

Price calculation, method availability and delivery time prediction can be customized with plugins.

One of the significant challenges web shop owners face, is choosing the best ways to ship products to their customers. It is necessary to account for the huge variety of possible shipping carriers - companies that provide shipping services (e.g. DHL, FedEx) as well as shipping methods - shipping services provided by the carrier ( e.g. DHL Express Delivery, DHL Standard ), their availabilities, prices and delivery times. The Shipping feature allows you to easily handle these all: you can create, edit, disable and remove store shipment methods and carriers, define corresponding delivery cost calculations to shipment so that you can offer different shipping methods for different stores, define tax sets and more.
