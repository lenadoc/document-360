Regular buyers, and especially B2B wholesale customers, often know what exactly they want to order from the shop - by product SKU, product name, etc. The Quick Order feature enables your customers to find and buy products in just a few clicks. Instead of going to each product page individually, they can go to the Quick Order page, accessible directly from the header, and quickly order items by typing product SKU and its quantity in respective fields. At the same time, if some specific [quantity restrictions](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/product-quantity-restrictions-overview) apply to products, they will also be taken into account when ordering through the Quick Order page. The Quick Order form can also be used to add items to [shopping lists](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/multiple-shared-shopping-lists). Also, if a customer has a list of products to be ordered, for example in a .csv file or other, the ordering process becomes even faster. The customer can bulk add SKUs and put quantities next to them in a single field. This being done, the customer either adds the items to cart or proceeds directly to checkout.

Placing an order through the Quick Order page requires significantly less navigation. This adds convenience and saves time for your new and returning customers, encouraging them to come back and buy more.
