## Upgrading from Version 0.* to Version 0.8.0
@(Info)()(In order to dismantle the Horizontal Barrier and enable partial module updates on projects, a Technical Release took place. Public API of source and target major versions are equal. No migration efforts are required. Please [contact us](https://support.spryker.com/hc/en-us) if you have any questions.)

## Upgrading from Version 1.0.0* to Version 2.0.0
From version 2 we have removed the disabled users from the shared list. The ability to enable/disable users was added to the CompanyUser module version 2.0.0.
To upgrade to the new version of the module, do the following:
1. Upgrade the CompanyUser module to version 2.0.0. See _Migration Guide - CompanyUser_  for more details:
```yaml
composer require spryker/company-user: “^2.0.0”
```
2. Regenerate transfer objects:
```yaml
vendor/bin/console transfer:generate
```
*Estimated migration time: 10 minutes*
