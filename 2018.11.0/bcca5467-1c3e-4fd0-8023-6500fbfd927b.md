The **Content Management** section in Back Office is mostly used by Content Managers and Marketing Team.
***
The section is designed to create, manage and display content in the storefront. The content is represented by **CMS Pages**, **CMS Blocks**, **Content Items**, and **Content Item Widgets**. This section also allows you to set up a URL redirect from one site to another. For example, you have several sites for your shop. However, you decide to remove one of them to display all the content on one website.

@(Info)()(This is how a marketing team can work with the content using the Back Office and interact with other departments to launch a marketing campaign.)

In the **Content Management** section, you can see the following:

* Blocks
* Pages
* Redirects
* Content Items

**Content Item** is a new abstraction layer for any content you want to display in your shop storefront. They can later be inserted in any placeholder of a page or a block via widgets coupled with the template that defines where and how the content is displayed on the shop website.

**Content item widget** is a content snippet you can use to display the page content that can be, for instance, adjustable to some specific marketing events. 

**CMS blocks** are parts of the page content that can be used for banners, charts, static links, banner images or similar items to be displayed throughout the shop website. 

**CMS pages** are additional pages you can create and manage to provide additional information about the shop like About Us, Terms and Conditions pages, or landing pages for promotions.
