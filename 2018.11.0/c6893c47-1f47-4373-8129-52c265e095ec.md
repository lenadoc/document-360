@(Info)()(Each product can be related to a tax set which contains the tax rates for each destination country.)

**Structure**:

* A Tax Set has a name (e.g. "Food") It represents a group of products which have the same tax rates
* The Rate (e.g. 19%) is stored in `spy_tax_rate`. There is one Rate per Country which allows tax conversions for cross-border shipments.
