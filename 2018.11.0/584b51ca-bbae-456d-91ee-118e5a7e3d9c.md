Fill in the required (*) fields to complete the registration.

After the company has been registered, it should be approved in the [Administration Interface](https://documentation.spryker.com/v3/docs/companies.htm#Approvin) to continue building the hierarchy.

Once the company is approved, a Company Administrator can go to `/company/overview` page and create (and then also edit and delete) users, addresses, roles and business roles.

@(Info)()(A Company Administrator needs to log out and then log in to refresh the changes.)
