Product Lists section in Back Office is designed to set specific restrictions for the **B2B** customers. 
***
**This feature is used for B2B purposes only as the restrictions are set based on merchant relations.**
***
This is a page where Shop Administrators can define product restrictions for a defined set of products by adding them to an appropriate product list.
The product restrictions work on the basis of whitelist/blacklist lists:
* Whitelist: Products included in this product list type are always available for the customers.
* Blacklist: Products included in this product list type are hidden from the customer view.
In other words, blacklists and white lists are the conditions under which a product (a list of products) is displayed in the store for a specific merchant relation. If the product is blacklisted, the merchant relation company representative is not able to see it and search for it. 
If a specific product (or a list of products) is whitelisted, the merchant relation company representative is able to see and search for only this specific product (list of products). The others are hidden from the view.
