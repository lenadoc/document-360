This topic describes the procedure of setting up category filters.
***
To start setting up the category filters, navigate to the **Search and Filters > Category Filters** section.
***
**Prerequisites**
To set up a category filter, you need to have a filter preference setup in the **Search and Filters > Filter Preferences** section.
@(Error)(Note)(Before adding a filter to the category, make sure that the product (with an attribute with a specific attribute key for which a filter preference exists is assigned to this specific category. Otherwise, the filter will not bring any results once selected in the online store.)
***
On the **Overview of Category Filters** page, you see the **Root nodes list**, **Category tree**, and 
**Category Filters for** sections. You select the root in the **Root nodes list** by clicking on it and the **Category tree** section is updated to show the categories in the node.

To manage the category filters, you click on a specific category and the **Category Filters for** section appears displaying the active filters that are already assigned to a category and the **Add filter** field.

## Adding a Filter to a Category
This procedure will show you how to customize filter behavior by adding the filters to category.

**To add a filter to the category:**
1. Select the root category from the Root nodes list table.
    The Category tree will be populated by the nodes nested under the selected root category.
2. Choose a category for which you would like to overwrite the default global settings.
    To find a specific category, start entering its name in the **Search** field and the results will be automatically highlighted in the category tree.
3. After selecting a category, the Category Filters for [Category name] frame opens to show the current configuration.

    Categories in the category tree view that have manually defined filter settings are marked with a pencil icon next to their name.
