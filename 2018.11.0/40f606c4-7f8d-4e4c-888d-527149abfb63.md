The Merchants section in Back Office is mostly used by E-Commerce managers. In a B2B environment, the business partnership between a buyer (company/business unit) and a seller (merchant) is often based on a range of agreements. So you should consider the Merchant and Merchant Relation sections as a contract between the seller and buyer.

@(Info)()(This is how the E-Commerce manager sets up the merchant and merchant relations according to the contract conditions. )
@(Warning)(Note)(For a common B2B solution it should be only one merchant in the system, as two and more merchants are required only for B2B Marketplaces.)
***
The Merchants section in Back Office is designed to set up the contract conditions.

The Merchant Relations section is tight to the **Company Account > Companies** and **Company Units** sections as when you create the relation, you select the company and the respective business unit based on the contract.

In order to have a correct set, you should:
* Have a company set up done in the **Company Account** section. This company is the one with which the contract is signed. (See articles in the _Company Account_ section.)
* Create a merchant
* Set up a merchant relation.
