The Checkout workflow is a multi-step process that can be fully customized to fit your needs. The standard steps included are: customer registration and login, shipping and billing address, shipment method and costs, payment method, checkout overview and checkout success. You can easily design the process to accommodate different checkout types and to adapt to different preferences, such as one-page checkout or an invoice page replacing the payment page, by means of our step-engine.

The checkout is based on a flexible step engine and can be adjusted to any use case:

* Highly customizable because of underlying step engine
* Checkout as guest, registered customer or register in the checkout flow
* Hooks for the integration of any payment or shipment methods
* Progress bar to navigate between checkout steps
