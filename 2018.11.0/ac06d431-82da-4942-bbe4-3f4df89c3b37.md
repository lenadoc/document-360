The topic describes how to create a category and a product details page by assigning CMS blocks to those pages.
***
This might be useful if you decided to hold a marketing campaign, a set of activities (sales, discounts) geared towards some event or add a banner to the page. In this case, you can embed a CMS block containing the marketing content that will be displayed only on category or product detail pages you specify.
***
To start creating the category or product detail pages, navigate to the **Content Management > Blocks** section.
