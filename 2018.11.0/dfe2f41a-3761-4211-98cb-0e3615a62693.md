The Spryker Commerce OS lets you flexibly define values for selling your products in weight, length or quantity. Depending on the items you are selling, you offer meters and centimeters, kg and pounds or other units. Individual Packaging enables you to sell the same item in different bundle sizes. This enables you to enrich your product choice and gives more flexibility for your customers. They can freely decide if they want to purchase a single bottle or a whole crate.
