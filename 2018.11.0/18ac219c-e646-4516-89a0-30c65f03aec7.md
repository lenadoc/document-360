Categories are a tool to manage product catalog. With the Category management feature, you can create customized categories, category pages and filters to easily handle and sort your items. All products can be categorized into logical clusters, so that your customers can filter them in your shop. Easily define if categories are active, visible, searchable or hidden from your customers. Depending on your business needs, choose between a number of category templates and assign images to those categories to compliment your shop.
