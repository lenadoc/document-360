This section applies to Yves and contains information on how the frontend is built in Spryker.

Spryker frontend implements a design methodology called **atomic design**. Due to this, the UI layer of Spryker is called Atomic Frontend.

The [Atomic Frontend](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/atomic-frontend) guide describes the basic principles of Spryker UI implementation and explains how to perform the tasks required to design the Spryker UI.

As for the Spryker frontend modules, they are split in two big groups - Pages and Widgets. The [Modular Frontend](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/modular-frontend) guide provides an overview of the Pages and Widgets modules, explaining what they are and how to use them.
