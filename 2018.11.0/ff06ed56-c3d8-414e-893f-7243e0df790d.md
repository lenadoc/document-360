With Timed Product Availability, you can easily define from and till when your product(s) will be visible and available for purchase by your customers, without having to manually manage your inventory. This feature is extremely useful if you sell products with an expiry date, seasonal products or products that are valid for a certain period of time (e.g. tickets). If for promotional reasons, you temporally sell some products within a limited time frame, or if you want to start selling some products (e.g. a collection) from a specific date and time, the product validity time can be set to up-to-the-minute accuracy.
