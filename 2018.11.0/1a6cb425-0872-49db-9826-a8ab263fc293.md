At its core, Product Restrictions allow merchants to define the products that are available to each of their B2B customers.

In terms of [Merchant concept](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/merchants-and-merchant-relations-overview), the **merchant** is the one who sells products on a marketplace and can set prices.

The diagram below shows product restrictions relations within the Merchant concept:

Product Restrictions from Merchant to Buyer give merchants [another layer](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/hide-content-from-logged-out-users) of control over the information, a customer can see in the shop application. Based on product restrictions, you can:

* create a list of products;
* hide the product information for the products (pricing, appearance in the search/filters), and limit access to a product details page.

Product Restriction feature works on the basis of whitelist/blacklist lists. That means that products that are added to whitelist are always shown to a customer while blacklisted products are hidden from the customer view.

To restrict the products, a Shop Administrator needs to create a product list, include the necessary products to the list and blacklist them for a specific merchant relationship. All other products will be available for that merchant relationship.

To create product lists, follow the [guideline for the Back Office](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/creating-a-product-list).

You can check more cases of product restrictions workflow on the [Restricted Products Behavior](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/restricted-products-behavior) page.

## Current Constraints
- Currently, in the situation, when a single product from the product set is blacklisted, the other items are displayed in the shop. We are going to update the logic in a way, that in case any of the items in the product set gets blacklisted, all relevant product sets containing this item will get blacklisted too.
-  The current functionality allows displaying the whole product bundle even if it contains the blacklisted customer-specific products. We are working on updating the logic so that if the bundle product includes a blacklisted item, the whole bundle is also blacklisted for a customer.
