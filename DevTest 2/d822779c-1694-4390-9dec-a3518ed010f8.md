Shopping list is a list of the items that shoppers buy or plan to buy frequently or on a regular basis. For example, a consumer can compile a shopping list of the products they purchase every week.

## Creating and Managing (Multiple) Shopping Lists
There are two ways to create a shopping list:

* through a shopping list widget in the header of site
* from _Shopping Lists_ page in _My Account_ menu

New items are added to shopping lists by clicking *Add to Shopping List* on the product details page.

Customers can create not just one, but **multiple shopping lists** to be used for different needs or to purchase products at different time periods.

@(Info)()(These could be, for instance, separate shopping lists for daily, weekly and monthly purchases.)

After a shopping list has been created, it appears in the shopping lists table on *Shopping Lists* page in *My Account*. To place an order, customers simply select the check box next to each shopping list, the items of which they wish to order, and click **Add selected to cart**.

The table with shopping lists shows details for each of the lists, including:

* Name of shopping list owner, i.e. person who created the shopping list
* Creation date
* Access rights (read only or full access) granted to the current user
* Possible actions to manage shopping lists: edit, print, delete, share, dismiss (for shared shopping lists)

When clicking **Edit** for a shopping list, the customer is taken to _Edit shopping list_ page, where they can:

* Rename shopping list
* Remove shopping list items
* View shopping list access rights granted to them
* Change quantity of items in the shopping list
* Add comments to items (check Shopping list notes for more details)
* Delete the shopping list

## Permissions Management for Shared Shopping Lists

Users of companies with business units can **share** their shopping lists within the company business units. The shopping lists can either be shared with the entire business unit, or its individual members. Customers can view shopping lists shared with them, on *My Account->Shopping lists*page. The shopping lists can be shared by clicking **Share** at this page as well. The *Share [SHOPPING LIST NAME]* page consists of two sections: Business Units and Users. Here, the shopping list owner can select either entire business units, or individual users to share the shopping list with.

There are three types of shopping list access rights that can be granted

* no access
* read only
* full access

### No Access
**No access** means that shopping list is not shared and therefore can not be seen by a business unit/user.

### Read only
**_Read only_** permissions allows:

## Full access
**_Full access_** permissions allows:

   * Quantity
   * Item price

6. **Sharing shopping list**: The shopping list can be shared by clicking *Share* button or *Shared with* link

7. **Deleting shopping list**

8. **Deleting items in shopping list**: The shopping list items can be deleted on *Edit Shopping list* page

It is possible to grant different access rights on shopping list to a business unit and users belonging to it. For example, a shopping list can be shared with *Read only* permissions to a business unit, but some of its users might be granted *Full access* permissions. In this case, these users will have *Full access* for the shopping list, whereas the rest of the business unit members will be entitled to *Read only* access.

If user does not need a list, that has been shared with them, it is possible to remove it from their shopping lists and thus cancel the sharing. To do so, the user clicks **Dismiss** on *Shopping Lists* page in *Actions* next to the respective shared shopping list. It is possible to dismiss sharing shopping lists with both *Read only* and *Full access* rights. Own shopping lists can not be dismissed.

A shopping list can be **deleted** on *Shopping Lists* and *Shopping List Edit* pages.

@(Warning)()(Deleting a shared shopping list also deletes it for users it has been shared with.)
