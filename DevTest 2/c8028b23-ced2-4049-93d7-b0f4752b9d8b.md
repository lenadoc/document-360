In version 2, validity dates allow to preset date boundaries for each navigation node to control their own and their descendants visibility.

* Upgrade Navigation module to at least 2.0.0 version. Click here to learn how to migrate the Navigation module.
* Update the NavigationGui module to at least 2.0.0 version in your `composer.json`.
* Make sure the new Zed user interface assets are built by running `npm run zed` (or `antelope build zed` for older versions).

Now validity dates will be stored in Storage.To apply validity dates on navigation node display, take a look on Navigation feature integration.
