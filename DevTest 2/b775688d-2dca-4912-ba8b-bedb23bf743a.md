Inventory is the amount of products you offer to your customers. These products are catalogued and divided into items that are in stock and reserved. The stock value is the physical amount of products you have in your warehouse, whereas availability is an aggregated value per store which reflects current quantity of products taking into account reservations, i.e. open (reserved) orders.
