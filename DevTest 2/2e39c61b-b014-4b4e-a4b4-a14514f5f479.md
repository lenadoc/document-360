In B2B commerce transactions, prices are typically negotiated in contracts, therefore merchants and their clients, which are usually company business units, expect to see their own prices in the shop. With the Prices per Merchant Relation(Customer specific prices) feature, the shop owners of B2B/B2C marketplace can provide different prices for merchants and their clients. This way the relationship between merchants and buyers is reflected more accurately, and the shop owners can set different prices for various segments of customers.
