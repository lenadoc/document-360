## Upgrading from Version 1.1.0 to Version 2.0.0
In this version, the import key `company-user` has been assigned to the `CompanyUserDataImport`. `BusinessOnBehalfDataImport` now uses `company-user-on-behalf`. To migrate, just use the other key because the previous was repurposed.
Therefore, if you have any custom deployment or importing script that used the console command:
`vendor/bin/console data:import company-user`
Change it to:
`vendor/bin/console data:import company-user-on-behalf`
The import key company-user is now assigned to the `CompanyUserDataImport`.
