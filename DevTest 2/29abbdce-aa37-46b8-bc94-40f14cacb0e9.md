## Upgrading from Version 3.* to Version 4.*
In version 4 we have added support for multi-currency. First of all make sure you have migrated the Price module. 
We have changed the way the default price type is assigned, it's not coming from the new price module, also the price will be assigned based on the current price mode, currency, type combination.
