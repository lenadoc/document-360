## Adding Items to a New Shopping List

* <a href="#edit">While editing the shopping list</a>

## Adding Products from the Product Detail Page

1. Navigate to a product detail page of the product you would like to add to a shopping list.
2. From the drop-down list, select the name of the shopping list where you want to add a product item and click **Add to Shopping list**.
