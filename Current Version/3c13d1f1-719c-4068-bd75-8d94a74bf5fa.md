Managing your customers effectively is an important part of your e-commerce business. The whole customers management is done through the Customers menu in the Administration Interface, which is divided into two section: Customers and Customer Groups. Customers is the area where all the data of users that have ever had an account in your web-shop is stored. Here you can create, edit and delete customers, as well as view their orders.

From the Customer Group section, you can organize customers into groups that can share, for example, the same discounts or promotions.
