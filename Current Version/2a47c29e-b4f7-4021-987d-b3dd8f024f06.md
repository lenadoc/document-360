To open this page, go to Category.

Managing volumes of products requires being able to group together items under specific criteria. With the Category feature, you can group and build hierarchies of products by category. This is how a shop administrator can create a structure to display products by, for example, Electronics. Under this category, you can group all of your products that meet this criteria. Furthermore, you can create nested categories that split the products into smaller groups such as TVs, Mobile Phones, DVDs, etc.

Products can be assigned to any number of Categories by any random or logical category you need. This allows you to create categories such as Summer Sale, Bargain Basement or any other categorization that suits your purposes. The primary uses of categories are to build dynamic category pages and enhance your store's search and filter capabilities.

From the Category menu, you can:
> [Create a new product category](#creating-a-new-product-category)
>[Assign products to a category](#assigning-products-to-categories)
>[Define a template to a category](#assigning-a-template-to-a-category-page)
>[Manage category details](#ordering-categories)
>[Assign images to categories](#assigning-an-image-to-a-category-in-admin-ui)
