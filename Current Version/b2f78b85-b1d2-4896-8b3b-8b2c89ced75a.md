In B2B business environment, media management can become a tricky task for e-commerce store owners. At some point or another a merchant would need their e-commerce shop to include an option to upload the text or media files (e.g. tutorials, instructions, license agreements, additional pictures or photos) for the products and easily manage them within the system.

File Uploader feature allows a Store Administrator to upload files in accordance to their specifications for a file type to the Administration Interface, place them in CMS Widgets as blocks or pages in the shop so that end customers can click on them and download the files.
