@(Info)()(This is how the Marketing Content Manager interacts with the other departments and team members to introduce the planned discounts and use the Back Office to create those.)
Discounts that you create can either be cart-based or in the form of vouchers. Also, discounts can be set to be "exclusive."
In terms of the way a discount is calculated, there are two types of discounts: the percentage discount and fixed amount discount.
