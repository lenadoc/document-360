In order to maintain a clear Role and Permission system, you can easily manage what kind of competencies each User has in your shop environment. Any kind of business logic, from simple checks, like single permissions, to complex ones, like purchasing limit, customer allocation and business unit check, can be created to serve your specific needs.

A Company User may have one or multiple "Roles". These roles consist of permissions, which are precisely configurable according to the actions the Company User with that role is permitted to carry out.
