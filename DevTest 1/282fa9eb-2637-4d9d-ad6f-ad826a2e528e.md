It's typical that in the B2B business model a company would like to sell personalized products to some of their customers, whilst hiding these products from the others. Both of these cases can be set up with the help of the Product Restrictions from Merchant to Buyer feature in Spryker OS. This feature gives you more control over what information customers can see in your shop. Also, providing clients with access to the products and information they need without overwhelming them with non-essential data is crucial for customer satisfaction.
