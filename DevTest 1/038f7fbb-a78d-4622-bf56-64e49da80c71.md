Boost your sales and increase traffic by giving out voucher codes to your customers so they can get a discount on their purchases. Voucher Codes can be one-time-only or multiple-use codes with a value and validity that can be freely defined. Also, all vouchers are grouped in clusters for a better overview and can be exported for easier handling. All Voucher Codes are added in the cart or checkout and will be applied to the respective products.

Voucher codes can be given to customers so that they can redeem them in the checkout. Voucher codes are grouped into pools. It is possible to create single vouchers that can be used by multiple customers or a pool with dedicated one-time voucher codes per customer.

* Named voucher pools
* Voucher codes can be marked as "once-per-customer" to disallow repeated usages but they can also be reusable
* Voucher codes can be marked as "refundable"
* Optional: total maximum number of uses per voucher code
* Customer codes including additional random generated characters
