Align your business with international tax standards by defining tax rates and sets. Determine country-based tax rates for products, options and shipments, that will automatically be applied to the respective shops.

In a tax system, the tax rate is the ratio (usually expressed as a percentage) at which a business, person, items are taxed.

Tax set is a set of tax rates that can be applied to a specific product.

Keeping that in mind, the tax rate is created first.

Once the rate is defined, you can attach it to a tax set(s). A tax set can contain from one to many tax rates.

The described values are defined in the **Back Office** > **Taxes** section.
