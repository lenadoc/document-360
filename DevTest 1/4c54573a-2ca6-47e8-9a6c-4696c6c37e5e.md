Spryker enables integration with New Relic for performance monitoring. New Relic contains a set of powerful features that helps you monitor the performance and health of your application. To be able to use New Relic you must first get an account. Next, you will need to install the New Relic PHP extension in your virtual machine by following the steps described [here](https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/1131235/applications/setup).

## New Relic Logs
### Request logging
Every request is automatically logged by New Relic. The name of the requests will be the name of the used route for Yves and the `[module]/[controller]/[action]` for Zed. You’ll also find the request URI and the host stored as custom parameters for each request.

### Error logging
Every error will be logged in New Relic together with its detailed stack trace.

### Console command logging
Every executed console command will be logged by New Relic.

### Deployment logging
To be able to use the deployment recording feature of New Relic, you need to add your `api_key` to the project config. The api key is generated on your New Relic account. Open your account settings in New Relic and enable the API Access in the Data Sharing page. After enabling you’ll get your api key.

```json
$config[\Spryker\Shared\NewRelic\NewRelicConfig::NEWRELIC_API_KEY] = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
```

## New Relic API
You can add custom New Relic events in your application with the API wrapper for New Relic that you can find in `\Spryker\Shared\NewRelic\Api`.

To read more detailed information about the available API methods, please read the following documentation: [New Relic API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/php-agent/php-agent-api).
