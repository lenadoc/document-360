Once the shop administrator has received a claim regarding an order from the customer, they can go to Overview of Orders in the Administration Interface and click **Claim** to register the claim for the order (for all items or separate items of the order).

After the reclamation has been created, it appears on the Reclamations page under the **Sales** menu in the Administration Interface. Each reclamation is linked to a specific order by order ID, however, one and the same order can have more than one reclamation.

With the reclamations in place, you can find the problematic issues with orders that a shop owner has (e.g., the product is faulty or broken) and manage them.

@(Error)()(Due to the specificity of the state machine for every project, out of the box, the “refunded” state is not reflected in OMS in any way - it is just a mark for the shop administrators signifying that the order has been refunded.)

The reclamations can have two states - open and closed. The closed state of a reclamation means that there is nothing to do on it anymore, therefore it can not be reopened.
