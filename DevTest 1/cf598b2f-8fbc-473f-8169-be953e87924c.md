Products that were recently added to your shop can automatically be marked with the Dynamic Product Label "New" for a pre-defined time range. When importing or creating new products, simply add validity dates for the **New** label.

You can import any data to dynamically assign labels to products.

This is basically a type of product label, see Dynamic Product Labels for more information.
