A new tax calculator must be registered in  `CalculationDependencyProvider::getCalculatorStack()`.

Add `ExpenseTaxWithDiscountsCalculatorPlugin` to the discount calculator block, after `DiscountCalculatorPlugin`.

```php
//..
use Spryker\Zed\DiscountCalculationConnector\Communication\Plugin;

class CalculationDependencyProvider extends SprykerCalculationDependencyProvider
{

    /**
     * @param \Spryker\Zed\Kernel\Container $container
     * @return \Spryker\Zed\Calculation\Dependency\Plugin\CalculatorPluginInterface[]
     */
    protected function getCalculatorStack(Container $container)
    {
        return [
            .... other existing plugins .....

            new ExpenseTaxWithDiscountsCalculatorPlugin(),

        ];
    }
```
