You can easily establish your own set of rules for triggering specific Product Promotions. Product Attributes, Cart Values, seasonal sales or events are only a few examples.

Consider the product promotion as a discount with a different types and conditions. It can be:

* available for one or multiple stores
* applied only to products of, for example, green color
* exclusive or non-exclusive
* of a fixed amount or calculated in percentage

You can set a discount validity period to promote your product during a special event.

All that is managed via a Back Office.
