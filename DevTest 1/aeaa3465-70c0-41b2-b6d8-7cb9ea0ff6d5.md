## Upgrading from Version 1.* to Version 2.*
In version 2 we have added multi-currency support. First of all make sure you migrated the Price module. We have changed Zed table to use `PriceProductFacade` for retrieving product prices. We have also changed `\Spryker\Client\ProductRelation\Storage\ProductRelationStorage` to resolve ProductRelation prices based on the selected currency, price mode combination. If you modified this class in project or extended it, you may want adapt to core version.
