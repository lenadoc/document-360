## Upgrading from Version 1.* to Version 2.*

From version 2 we have support multi-currency. First of all make sure you have migrated the Price module. We have changed collector dependency to use `PriceProduct` module instead of price, please update your code accordingly if you overwrote the core. If you modified `ProductAbstractTableHelper` table class, then this class now receives different bridge `ProductSetGuiToPriceProductFacadeInterface` insted of `ProductSetGuiToPriceProductInterface`.
