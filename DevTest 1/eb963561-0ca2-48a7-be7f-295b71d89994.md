To break boundaries between online and offline users, we have implemented a shopping cart sharing facility with the option of generating unique URLs. The feature allows you to generate a link to your cart and share it within your business unit (in case of a B2B environment) with various access permissions, or even with the external users in a read-only mode. This way, users can exchange their opinions on the order (cart), eventually correct it, share with other users, in social networks etc. This adds convenience for your existing customers, builds their loyalty and helps to attract new buyers.

Sales Representatives can use this feature for pre-sales activities, promotions, and internal negotiations. They can also prepare a cart for customers to make an order, which minimizes customersâ€™ mistakes and increases sales.
