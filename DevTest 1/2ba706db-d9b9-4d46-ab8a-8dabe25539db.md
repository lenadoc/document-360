## Upgrading from Version 1.* to Version 2.*
Version 2.0.0 of the ContentGui module introduces the content items functionality that allows creating and managing content and later selecting where it should be inserted.

The ContentGui module version 2.0.0 introduced the following changes:

* Adjusted models to support parameter KEY of Content.
* Introduced the `ContentTransfer::$key` transfer object property.
* Changed a header in `EditContent/index.twig` to use a key instead of the ID.
* Increased the version of `spryker/content` in composer.json.

**To upgrade to the new version of the module, do the following:**
1. Perform the steps in _Migration Guide - Content_.
2. Upgrade the `ContentGui` module to version 2.0.0:

```bash
composer require spryker/content-gui:"^2.0.0" --update-with-dependencies
```
3. Run the following command to re-generate transfer objects:

```bash
console transfer:generate
```
4. Run the following command to re-build Zed UI:

```bash
 console frontend:zed:build
 ```
_Estimated migration time: 30 minutes_
